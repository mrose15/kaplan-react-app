#### Notes as of 2/24: This is my first react app. I began building on the evening of Friday 2/19. The majority of this was built over the weekend on 2/18 + 2/19. I spent additional time on this at night during the week of 2/22 for about 2-3 hours each day
In that time I learned:
- How to spin up a React app with Create React App
- React components
- A little about hooks 
- How to structure my folder for components 
- How to load sass into the project
- How to pull in data with Axios
- How to filter content dynamically
- How to build an accessible modal (with the exception of accessing the modal with tab + enter on the "Create New Book" button)
I built a form that will take in user input and save it to local storage. I got as far as building the form and saving to state. I was unable to figure out how to render it to screen. My BookList.js file was initially set up with a JS class structure but I was unable to find out how to pass props to a class.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
